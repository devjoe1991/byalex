              A native of Colombia, Alex Perez's culinary passion was first sparked in the dynamic street food markets of London and Spain. It was there he developed his signature style of bold, unapologetic flavors. After advancing his skills in several acclaimed kitchens, Alex chose to focus on the heart of cooking itself—perfecting all foods with dedication and creativity. While he holds a special affection for chicken, his true passion lies in the quality and joy of every single dish that emerges from his kitchen. Driven by a simple mantra—use the best ingredients, embrace experimentation, and create happiness through food—Alex is now delighting Londoners with his creations at The Brondesage pub.
